                <p>AWS is fully aware that your data is not to be treated as 
                    exactly the same, as there are different need cases for 
                    all types of data.</p>
                <h3>Data Storage Categorization -</h3>
                <h3>Block Storage:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data is stored in chunks known as blocks.</li>
                    <li>Blocks are stored on a volume and attached to a single instance.</li>
                    <li>Provide very low latency data access.</li>
                    <li>Comparable to DAS storage used on premises.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>File Storage:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data is stored as separate files with a series of directories.</li>
                    <li>Data is stored within a file system.</li>
                    <li>Shared access is provided for multiple users.</li>
                    <li>Comparable to NAS storage used on premises</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Object Storage:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Objects are stored across a flat address space.</li>
                    <li>Objects are referenced by a unique key.</li>
                    <li>Each object can also have associated metadata to help categorize and identify the object.</li>
                </ul>
